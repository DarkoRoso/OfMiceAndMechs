## state of the game

* The game looks good enough for me and the mechanics work most of the time, too.
* The cutscenes need more work but they are ok for now, too.
* there is a lot of storytelling (in relation to other content)
* Minigames like fireing the ovens or driving the mechs trough walls are fun for me
* crashes do happen but not constantly
* The game feels like a game (a boring one, but like a game)

I think the biggest issue currenty is that the main game mechanic is not working or is not clearly visible. This is gaining control (over npcs), controlling npcs and exercising power to gain power. The negation of this is also missing. This is loosing power by inefficent use of power or by not defending your position.
