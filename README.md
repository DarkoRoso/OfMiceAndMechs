# OfMiceAndMechs
some prototype for a game

== biggest current issue ==

The biggest issue is that the game doesn't feel like a game yet.

* The game looks good enough for me and the mechanics work most of the time, too.
* The cutscenes need more work but they are ok for now, too.
* there is a lot of storytelling (in relation to other content)
* Minigames like fireing the ovens or driving the mechs trough walls are fun for me
* crashes do happen but not constantly

I think the thing missing is the feeling of purpose, progress, adventure and discovery.

== news ==

unicode issues are resolved by having a almost pure ASCII renderer as default. Unicode modes can still be configured and can be toggled while playing using '`' (default). This means the game is almost cross platform supporting linux and mac.
