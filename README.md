## state of the game

Quite some work was done on the game so far and has a playtime of 11 minutes at the time of writing. I try to get playtesters to play the game and meanwhile fix the bugs und broken features. This sadly means now real playtime extension for now and no significant progress with the story board.

At this stage it would really be useful to get help from whoever is reading this. I'll post a way for contacting me later and in the meantime i ask you to open issues if you have a github account. If not i explicitly ask you to not create an account for submitting an issue. Also if anybody knows a way to make annonymous issues possible please open an issue explaining it rigth now.

I will start to use branches with a dev branch with a lot if crashes and aim to keep the master somewhat stable, so you don't have to suffer through each crash i produce.

The detailed state of the game follows:

* The game looks good enough for me and the mechanics work most of the time, too.
* The cutscenes need more work but they are ok for now, too.
* there is a lot of storytelling (in relation to other content)
* Minigames like fireing the ovens or driving the mechs trough walls are fun for me
* crashes do happen but not constantly
* The game feels like a game (a boring one, but like a game)
* a save/load system exists, but saving crashes the game.
* The game offers a challenge, but still is somewhat uneventfull

Crashes and memory adresses in the gui are common. Also the save system is broken. So time for another cleanup round.

I think the biggest issue is that the main game mechanic is not working or is not clearly visible. This is gaining control (over npcs), controlling npcs and exercising power to gain power. The negation of this is also missing. This is loosing power by inefficent use of power or by not defending your position.

Development speed depends on Code quality, so it is a important issue. It is a pretty big issue and grows with every change done on the code, so this issue will probably never be solved. But it seems like code quality will improve if i keep a pattern of doing a round of new features and a round of code cleanup. Since code qualtiy cannot be too good it seems more reasonable to skip a feature adding round than skipping a cleanup round.
