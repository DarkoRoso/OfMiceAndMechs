## state of the game

* The game looks good enough for me and the mechanics work most of the time, too.
* The cutscenes need more work but they are ok for now, too.
* there is a lot of storytelling (in relation to other content)
* Minigames like fireing the ovens or driving the mechs trough walls are fun for me
* crashes do happen but not constantly
* The game feels like a game (a boring one, but like a game)

While trying to address the issue below i realized, the the biggest issue currently is the bad quality of code and the mockuped features. Players and me are hampert by encountering Not-Implemented-Yets and bugs. This slowed development down and needs to be adressed first.

For now i'll take a break from direct bugfixing and will try to implement a save function. I hope this will allow me to use savegames for faster testing and is an obvious lack of game character to not have a save function.

I think the second issue is that the main game mechanic is not working or is not clearly visible. This is gaining control (over npcs), controlling npcs and exercising power to gain power. The negation of this is also missing. This is loosing power by inefficent use of power or by not defending your position.
