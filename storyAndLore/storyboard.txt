abstracted story:
	tutorial phase with simulation restarts
	spawn as officer
		allow class selection based on resutls of previous runs

save system:
	simulation restart = gamestate is kept, character is ported back to engine room. minor details are discarded, alle quests resettet
		dying with low status and never having had a high status
	spawn as officer  = get woken up from full emersion machine get ceremony for achieving Manhood 8 Birthday. Details of world are discarded
		dying with having had a high status once
		dying without beeing recovered
	brain recovery = time gets forwarded
		dying with brain recovery
	synced brain = restart at last sync station
		dying while havin sync implant
	permadead = the whole world and gamestate gets killed
		dying while fugitive or vat duty
		treason
	execution because of danger to the current hegemony = permadead with credit screen
	Vat duty = gamestate is kept completely

interaction with your Environment is somewhat complicated

the basic Interationcommands are:

see this Piles of Coal marked with ӫ on the rigth Side of the Room.

whenever you bump into an item that is to big to be walked on, you will promted for giving an extra interaction command. I'll give you an example:

ΩΩ＠ӫӫ

 pressing a and j would result in Activation of the Furnace
 pressing d and j would result in Activation of the Pile
 pressing a and e would result make you examine the Furnace
 pressing d and e would result make you examine the Pile

please grab yourself some Coal from a pile by bumping into it and pressing j afterwards.
